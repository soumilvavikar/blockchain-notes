# zkSync Level Two Rollup Blockchain

zkSync offers a powerful combination of scalability, cost-efficiency, security, and compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. Its ability to significantly reduce transaction costs while maintaining high throughput makes it an attractive option for both users and developers. As the platform continues to evolve, particularly with the rollout of zkSync Era, it has the potential to play a crucial role in addressing Ethereum's scaling challenges and driving wider adoption of blockchain technology.

zkSync offers several compelling advantages that make it an attractive choice for users and developers in the Ethereum ecosystem. Here's an overview of why you might want to use zkSync:

- **Enhanced Scalability**
  - zkSync significantly improves Ethereum's transaction throughput
- **Reduced Transaction Costs**
  - Transaction costs can be as low as 1/100th of Layer 1 Ethereum gas fees
  - zkSync Era (2.0) promises an additional 100-times fee reduction for zkPorter users
- **Security and Finality**
  - It inherits the security of the Ethereum mainnet
  - Transactions achieve faster finality compared to optimistic rollups
  - The use of zero-knowledge proofs ensures that only valid state transitions are accepted
- **EVM Compatibility**
  - The platform is now EVM-compatible and EVM-equivalent
  - It supports most Ethereum opcodes, allowing for the execution of smart contracts
  - Existing Ethereum smart contracts and developer tools can work on zkSync with minimal modifications
  - This compatibility significantly lowers the barrier to entry for Ethereum developers and projects looking to leverage Layer 2 scaling
- **Improved User Experience**
  - Native account abstraction, allowing for more flexible account models
  - Support for "gasless meta-transactions," enabling users to pay gas fees in transferred tokens
  - Compatibility with existing wallets like MetaMask
- **Additional Benefits**
  - *Privacy Potential*: The use of zero-knowledge proofs opens up possibilities for enhanced privacy features in future iterations
  - *Frictionless Transfers*: Users can easily move assets between Layer 1 and Layer 2 without significant delays
  - *Censorship Resistance*: Assets can be moved back to Layer 1 at any time
  - *Support for NFTs*: zkSync enables native Layer 2 NFTs
